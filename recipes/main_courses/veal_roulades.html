            <li>3 OZ. (85 grams) of sausage</li>
            <li>4 TBSP. of Grana Padano, grated</li>
            <li>12 SLICES of flat pancetta</li>

            <li>3 TBSP. of mint, minced</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>4 OZ. (115 grams) of baby zucchini</li>
            <li>1/4 CUP of stale bread</li>
            <li>12 of Fontina or Taleggio cubes</li>
            <li>Dry white wine</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 CUP of beef broth</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the bread in the milk. Remove the sausage casing and crumble the sausage.
                Pound the veal slices with a meat tenderizer and trim them. Finely chop 1 1/2 oz. of the veal
                trimmings and add them to a bowl with the sausage, soaked bread, Grana Padano cheese,
                salt and pepper. Mix well to make a soft stuffing.</li>
            <li>Distribute the stuffing evenly onto the veal slices and place a fontina cube in the middle
                of each one. Beginning at the narrower end of 1 veal slice, roll up, enclosing the stuffing.
                Sprinkle with minced thyme. Wrap with a pancetta slice and secure with a toothpick.
                Repeat with the remaining veal slices.</li>
            <li>Slice the zucchini and brown them in a pan with 4 Tbsp. oil and a garlic clove; after 5
                minutes, remove from heat and add the minced mint and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Warm the broth over low heat. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil and a pat of butter in a large skillet over
                high heat. Add the veal roulades and brown on all sides for around 10 minutes. Add 1 cup wine
                and reduce the heat to minimum. Let the wine reduce by 3/4. Add the warm broth and a pat of
                butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with the zucchini.</li>
