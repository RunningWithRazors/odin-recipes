        <p>Risotto alla Milanese is a creamy saffron risotto that’s perhaps Milan’s most famous dish.
           Infused with the earthy flavor and golden tones of saffron, risotto Milanese comes together
           easily and never fails to impress.</p>
        
        <h3>List of Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 LB. (900-1400 grams) of carnaroli or arborino rice(superfino);</li>
            <li>1/3 CUP of unsalted butter;</li>
            <li>1/4 CUP of dry white wine;</li>
            <li>1 QT. (0.9 liters) of beef broth;</li>
            <li>Salt;</li>
            <li>1 OZ. / 30 grams of beef bone marrow (optional);</li>
            <li>1/3 CUP of onion, finely chopped;</li>
            <li>2 PACKETS of saffron;</li>
            <li>1/3 CUP of Parmigiano Reggiano, grated;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Over very low heat, melt 1 1/2 Tbsp. butter in a saucepan and the bone marrow (if using).
                Add the onion and cook gently to sweat the onion, until soft and translucent for around 5
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and toast it over high heat for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Be certain that
                the rice and onion are well coated with the butter. Add the wine and let cook until it has
                almost evaporated entirely. Start to add broth in 1 cup increments. Let the rice cook away
                and absorb the liquid before adding more. Stir occasionally. With the second cup add the
                saffron and continue cooking in this same way. It should take a total of around 16-20 minutes,
                depending on how well done you want the rice. Salt as needed.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the remaining butter and the cheese. Mix well for a
                soft, creamy consistency. Cover and let sit 1 minute, then serve.</li>
        </ol>
