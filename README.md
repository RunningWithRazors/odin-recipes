# odin-recipes
This website will be built entirely with HTML alone. It is the first of many small tutorial projects organized by Odin Project, an open-source curriculum designed to train anyone into becoming a full-stackdeveloper. I couldn't have done this without you, and this will be the first of many projects I want to work on. I couldn't have done this without you.
<p>This small tutorial is designed to test the basic HTML skills I've learned so far, and this is done by creating a fully-functional recipe list. I didn't want to create a list of random recipes, so I took it upon myself to create a rough layout, with <u>100% realistic and delicious Italian recipes.</u></p>

<p>I will focus on Italian cuisine, and will cover a few recipes that will take us through a selection of appetizers, main courses and finish with desserts.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this. If you're a fellow trainee of the Odin Project, I wish you good luck and extend you all my best wishes of a good life. If you're a reviewer or just a regular reader, I thank you for having taken your time to read this, you're awesome!</p>
