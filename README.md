# Odin Recipes
## Project Description:

<p>The goal of this tutorial project is to create a recipe list exclusively with HTML. I will make a full menu with working links. Clicking on a link will then automatically open a new webpage that will show the viewer the selected recipe, complete with a picture of the food, brief description, list of ingredients and all the cooking phases, from food preparation to the final product.</p>

### Challenges:

<p>As this is my first time working on a (albeit small) project, overall I can say I'm satisfied with my performance. I was able to easily organize my work, establish a layout and set up my code so that it was navigable and easy to understand. Working with HTML has been a fun experience and I plan on expanding my knowledge on the subject in the foreseeable future. On a minor note, I should also brush up on Markdown, so I could write better readme files in the future.</p>

<p>The greatest challenge I've encountered is understanding when to add and commit my files to my Git repository. There have been instances where I've committed a file and then regretted it, either because of a grammar or synthax mistake and wanted to revert and fix it. Deleting or replacing files has also been troublesome: I've deleted two files directly from GitHub, instead of deleting them through the terminal. I must learn to work better with Git repositories.</p>

## Installation:
- Clone the repository or download the source files.
- Open "index.html" in your browswer.

## Credits:

**To the Odin Project**:
<p>Thank you. Thank you for having set up such an awesome project. It's free, easy, and allows everyone to learn something new that has the potential of improving their lives and the opportunities to create and implement something new. In a world that's getting progressively taken over by Artificial Intelligences, you're continuing to put faith in regular human beings and to give us the means to combine technical expertise with creativity and passion.</p>

**To the Odin Project trainees**:
<p>We all come from different countries, from different walks of life, and yet we're all sharing the same road. I've read many tutorials and watched many videos, and in each of those I've read your names and seen your marks. I like to view us as individual travelers who've decided to walk the same path, climb the tallest of mountains and eventually reach their peaks. I hope to see you at the top.</p>

**To you, dear viewer**:
<p>To the person who either stumbled or purposefully looked for me, thank you for having taken your time to read this message. This is a small project, but it is my first project, and know that your curiosity is greatly valued. Thank you.</p>
