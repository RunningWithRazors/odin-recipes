Place the clams in a pot with 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup white wine, and a clove of garlic. Bring to the boil, replace the lid, reduce the heat and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the mussels in a pot with 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup wine and a clove of garlic, bring to the boil, cover, and cook for 1 minute until they open. Cook the shrimp tails in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then remove.</li>
            <li>Clean the cuttlefish, separating the bodies from the tentacles, then transfer to a saucepan of cold water and bring to the boil. After 7 minutes, remove the bodies and cook the tentacles for a further 5 minutes. Remove the clams and mussels from their shells, chop the cuttlefish, octopus, and shrimp, then toss together in a bowl to combine. Dress the seafood salad with salt, pepper, oil, parsley, and lemon.</li>
