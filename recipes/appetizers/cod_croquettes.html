        <p>The salt cod is one of the best known and appreciated fish in all Italian regions. It’s a famous ingredient used in popular kitchens.</p>
        <p>Baccalà Mantecato, whipped salt cod, is a Venetian classic. Coated in breadcrumbs and egg, the fried croquettes are an irresistible appetizer.</p>

        <h3>List of Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>14 OZ. of baccalà mantecato (salt cod spread);</li>
            <li>Bread crumbs;</li>
            <li>Salt;</li>
            <li>3 of large eggs;</li>
            <li>Peanut oil;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully combine the baccalà mantecato (whipped salt cod) with 1 egg and 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Season with salt if necessary. Divide into 22-24 portions. Mold each portion into a croquette shape. Beat 2 eggs in a shallow bowl, place bread crumbs in a second shallow bowl. Coat each croquette in the bread crumbs. Dip in the beaten egg and then again in the breadcrumbs, packing them down gently.</li>
            <li>Heat the peanut oil to 340°F. When the oil reaches temperature fry the croquettes until golden, turning occasionally, around 5-6 minutes. Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve immediately, piping hot, sprinkled with a bit of salt if desired.</li>
